Pokemol is short for Pocket Moloch, as it takes the Moloch DAO contracts and wraps them up into a user-friendly, mobile-first app. Pokemol uses wallets that are Smart Contracts themselves to deliver a forward-thinking dao experience. Users can interact freely in any device and browser, without the need for special browsers or extensions. The first Pokemol was designed and built for the [MetaCartel](https://metacartel.org 'MetaCartel').
