Open Source projects suffer from sustainable funding issues, which really sucks for everyone. These projects are quite literally humans working together to deliver public goods with no regard for generating revenue. These are some of the most valuable contributions to mankind, at least in the realm of code, and should be supported far more broadly.

Any open source repo on Github can register their repo at Gittron.me for the cost of gas (about 5–10 cents). This generates a Prime Bot, a programmatically unique digital asset built off the the codebase. We use various data points from the repo such as primary language, commits per hour, etc. to build the DNA of the Prime Bot. This DNA informs the chances of getting various bot parts, stats, and rare elements.

Once generated, this Prime Bot is now an autonomous fundraiser for the open source project associated. Anyone in the world can go to the Prime Bot’s page and support it for a price set by the owner. Supporting a Prime Bot clones the bot’s DNA and generates a similar but different bot known as a Support Bot and distributes it to the Supporter as a thank you.
