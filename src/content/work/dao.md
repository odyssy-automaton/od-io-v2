#### Summary

In order for Odyssy to efficiently operate as a Decentralized Autonomous Organism, our members needed an interface. With many teams working on DAO tools, but none near a milestone that we could reasonably build upon, we built our own frontend interface on top of a multisig proxy wallet to enhance DAO interactions and transparency, such as governance and transactional histories.

It also allows us to facilitate new interactions such as an ‘address book’ for members and data visualizations on the performance of Odyssy, its token, and individual members. All of our tools are built with open-source in mind, so that other communities and fork and iterate.
