Wander Coin is an experimental DApp and token model where there is a supply of one non-fungible token to test various game theories. The goal of the first experiment is to get the coin all the way around the world without touching the same wallet. This incentivizes sharing the coin with new users, lending a helping a hand to mass adoption of cryptocurrencies.
