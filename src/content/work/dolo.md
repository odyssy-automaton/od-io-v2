DOLO is a decentralized open learning organization, built and run by its members, iterating towards a smarter education system for all. DOLO is a brainchild of Odyssy and we are working alongside a community of educators to research and develop the tools needed.

Our first initiatives are to build a platform for educators to collaborate on their curriculum, course content, and pedagogies. The next step is to tie that into a decentralized learning platform where educators can deploy courses to students who earn blockchain-verified certificates and/or badges upon completion of a course or track.
