title: 'LandApart'
shortDescription: is like the Airbnb of nature. Keep private land wild. Enjoy quality time in nature.
longDescription: LandApart was created to address the growing demand for uncrowded, accessible outdoor spaces. With increasingly crowded cities, more folks are looking to get away - from the city and from the crowds. Campgrounds are often busy, and the backcountry isnâ€™t always an option. They work with landowners to provide access to their unique and wild lands.
