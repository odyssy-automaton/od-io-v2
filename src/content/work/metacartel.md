Similar to the Moloch DAO rallying around the narrative to spur on a successful delivery of ETH 2.0, the MetaCartel DAO formed to spur on the growth and development of human-facing applications. We decided to fork the Moloch contracts and game theory, but iterate forward on the product and user experience design of the DAOâ€™s interface. We wanted to experiment with open access and extend usability to enhance member participation and engagement, as well as sending a clear signal to the community about what we expect out of DApp usability going forward.

We partnered with Abridged to build the most modern implementation of a DAO interface possible.
