#### Summary of Work

BookBuilder is an end-to-end self-publishing platform for an enterprise level Publishing House. Users create books, within which they have a full suite of options to design a bookâ€™s cover as well as full content management, design, and layout of the interior. All the while, they can view and/or print an accurate pdf. When ready to publish, they can create an ISBN and either publish their book themselves or print and distribute it through the Publisher.

Odyssy built the original software, which was bought by the larger publisher, and we now act as their rapid prototyping team, iterating through new feature sets and microinteractions, enhancing/testing for production, and deploying updates to the master product which we also fully manage.
