#### Problem

BookBuilder is an end-to-end self-publishing platform for an enterprise level Publishing House. Users create books, within which they have a full suite of options to design a bookâ€™s cover as well as full content management, design, and layout of the interior. All the while, they can view and/or print an accurate pdf. When ready to publish, they can create an ISBN and either publish their book themselves or print and distribute it through the Publisher.

#### Solution

Odyssy built the original software, which was bought by the larger publisher, and we now act as their rapid prototyping team, iterating through new feature sets and microinteractions, enhancing/testing for production, and deploying updates to the master product.
