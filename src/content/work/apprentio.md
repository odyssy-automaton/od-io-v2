Talent is universal, but opportunity is not. Web3 has the potential to decentralize access to opportunity, provide an economic on-ramp for the underserved billions not benefiting from the digital economy, and deliver sustainable and equitable economic engines for all of our global citizens. To achieve these high aspirations, the blockchain community needs to attract problem solvers from all socioeconomic backgrounds, ethnicities, genders, sexual orientations, and ways of life. Our young people will be leading this revolution and the blockchain community should enable them with the tools, resources, mentorship, and project-based work to help them create their own sustainable economic engines... and contribute their own ideas.

Ultimately, Apprentio aims to provide youth an alternative path towards economic prosperity if they're unable to afford a University education.
