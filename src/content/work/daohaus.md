In Daohaus, you can discover and pledge to join existing daos, or summon your own.

Daos are a powerful new type of organization, where no one person is in control. Instead, the power is distributed amongst all members of the dao. In Moloch daos, Members are granted Shares in exchange for Tribute, with which they vote on proposals. Once funds are in a dao, not a single penny can be distributed without all members being able to vote on it.
