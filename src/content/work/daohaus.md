In Daohaus, you can discover and pledge to join existing daos, or summon your own.

All daos summoned on Daohaus use Moloch DAO contracts as their base, with user selected options such as currency and voting period lengths, allowing for composable daos to fit a number of use-cases. Every dao also gets its own mobile-first frontend, Pokemol, to utilize for submitting proposals and voting.
