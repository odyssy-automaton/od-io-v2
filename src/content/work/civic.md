#### Summary of Work

Civic is an open source project of Hack Oregon, built entirely by volunteers committed to neutral, nonpartisan exploration of civic analytics. The Civic Platform is essentially a data storytelling platform wired up with clean and reliable civic data, built with open source and modular data visualization components, so that other cities can build their own.

With some product definition work in hand, we formed a popup Product team to tackle Branding, translate their previous UX work into higher fidelity UI, and iterate through the unique design problems associated with a storytelling platform heavy on data. As theyâ€™re a volunteer-based workforce, we also developed an engineering workflow to facilitate rapid transition from design into code.
